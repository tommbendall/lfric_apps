"""
PSyclone Script for applying OpenMP transformations to Spectral Gravity Wave.

Provides:
  - `trans(psyir)`: orchestrates all OpenMP transformations.
    * Forces a dynamic-scheduled OMP **PARALLEL DO** over
      `do i = 1, meta_segments%num_segments` with an explicit PRIVATE list.
    * Clusters adjacent top-level loops into **PARALLEL regions** to amortize
      thread overheads.
    * Applies **STATIC-scheduled** OMP DO / PARALLEL DO to identified heavy
      k-loops (profiling hotspots).

Context (specific to gw_ussp_mod.F90):
  - Default scheduling is **static** everywhere **except** for the
    `meta_segments%num_segments` loop, which is explicitly **dynamic** to
    accommodate variable per-segment workloads.
  - Certain scalars are initialised prior to OpenMP transformation so that
    backends that emit FIRSTPRIVATE have a well-defined initial value.

Rationale:
  - Profiling indicates k-index loops writing to heavy variables dominate
    runtime. Static scheduling generally performs best for these loops, while
    the meta-segmentation loop benefits from dynamic scheduling due to load
    imbalance.
  - Grouping adjacent outer loops into a single parallel region reduces
    enter/exit overhead and improves locality.

Future Work:
  - As PSyclone evolves, revisit nowait/lastprivate usage and refine region
    boundaries.
