Vector Calculus for Vectors
===========================

Transporting or diffusing a *vector* is more involved than doing so for a
scalar, because the basis vectors of a curvilinear coordinate system change
from place to place. This page derives the evolution equation for each
contravariant component of a vector :math:`\mathbf{u}` that is both advected
and diffused, and shows how the extra terms (the Christoffel symbols) are
obtained from the coordinate Jacobian and the metric tensor described in
:ref:`coordinates_and_vectors_coordinate_systems`.

The equation
------------

We consider the vector transport equation with a conservative diffusion term,

.. math::
    :label: vector_equation

    \frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t}
    + \left(\mathbf{a}\cdot\nabla\right)\mathbf{u}
    = \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla\cdot\left(\rho\nu\nabla\mathbf{u}\right),

where :math:`\mathbf{a}` is the advecting wind (which may be :math:`\mathbf{u}`
itself), :math:`\rho` is the dry density and :math:`\nu` is a diffusion
coefficient. For a Cartesian coordinate system, each Cartesian component of
:math:`\mathbf{u}` simply obeys the scalar transport-diffusion equation. In
curvilinear coordinates this is not true for the components of
:math:`\mathbf{u}`, and the equation for each component contains extra terms.

Notation
--------

Coordinates are written :math:`\chi_i` (the coordinate system label is dropped
here), with :math:`\partial_i = \partial/\partial\chi_i`. As in
:ref:`coordinates_and_vectors_coordinate_systems`:

* the basis vectors :math:`\mathbf{e}_i` are the columns of the Jacobian
  :math:`J` from the coordinates to Cartesian coordinates, and the dual basis
  vectors :math:`\mathbf{e}^i` are the rows of :math:`J^{-1}`;
* the metric tensor is :math:`g_{ij}=\mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j`, i.e.
  :math:`g = J^TJ`, and its inverse is :math:`g^{ij}=\mathbf{e}^i\cdot\mathbf{e}^j
  = (J^{-1}J^{-T})_{ij}`;
* :math:`\sqrt{g}=\det J` is the volume of a cell with unit coordinate
  extents.

Vectors are written with contravariant components,
:math:`\mathbf{u}=\sum_i u^i\mathbf{e}_i`, and similarly
:math:`\mathbf{a}=\sum_i a^i\mathbf{e}_i`. Summations are written out
explicitly, rather than using the Einstein summation convention.

The contravariant component :math:`u^i` is obtained by taking the dot product
of a vector with :math:`\mathbf{e}^i`. The component form of
equation :eq:`vector_equation` is found by taking this dot product with every
term in the equation.

Christoffel symbols
-------------------

The basis vectors vary in space, so the derivative of a vector has
contributions from the change in the components *and* from the change in the
basis vectors:

.. math::

    \partial_j\mathbf{u} = \sum_k\left(\partial_j u^k\,\mathbf{e}_k
    + u^k\,\partial_j\mathbf{e}_k\right).

The derivative of a basis vector is itself a vector, so can be expanded in
the basis. The expansion coefficients are the *Christoffel symbols*
:math:`\Gamma^i_{jk}`,

.. math::
    :label: christoffel_definition

    \partial_j\mathbf{e}_k = \sum_i\Gamma^i_{jk}\,\mathbf{e}_i
    \qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad
    \Gamma^i_{jk} = \mathbf{e}^i\cdot\partial_j\mathbf{e}_k .

Substituting this in gives the :math:`i`-th component of
:math:`\partial_j\mathbf{u}`, which is the *covariant derivative* of the
component :math:`u^i`:

.. math::
    :label: covariant_derivative

    \nabla_j u^i = \partial_j u^i + \sum_k\Gamma^i_{jk}u^k .

The extra term is the correction for the changing basis vectors. The
Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower indices, since
:math:`\partial_j\mathbf{e}_k = \partial_j\partial_k\boldsymbol{\chi}
= \partial_k\mathbf{e}_j`.

Relation to the Jacobian and metric
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since :math:`[\mathbf{e}_k]_l=J_{lk}`, and the dual basis vectors are the rows
of :math:`J^{-1}`, equation :eq:`christoffel_definition` gives the Christoffel
symbols directly in terms of the *second* derivatives of the mapping to
Cartesian coordinates:

.. math::
    :label: christoffel_jacobian

    \Gamma^i_{jk} = \sum_l\left(J^{-1}\right)_{il}\,\partial_j J_{lk}
    = \sum_l\left(J^{-1}\right)_{il}
    \frac{\partial^2\chi^{(XYZ)}_l}{\partial\chi_j\,\partial\chi_k}.

Equivalently, they can be written using only the metric tensor,

.. math::
    :label: christoffel_metric

    \Gamma^i_{jk} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_m g^{im}\left(
    \partial_j g_{km} + \partial_k g_{jm} - \partial_m g_{jk}\right).

The two forms agree because :math:`\partial_j g_{km} = \partial_j
\left(\mathbf{e}_k\cdot\mathbf{e}_m\right)` can be expanded using
equation :eq:`christoffel_definition`. Two useful consequences are:

* If the Jacobian to Cartesian coordinates is constant (e.g. Cartesian
  coordinates on a plane), all Christoffel symbols vanish.
* Contracting over two indices gives (Jacobi's formula for the derivative of a
  determinant)

  .. math::
      :label: christoffel_trace

      \sum_j\Gamma^j_{jk} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j,m}g^{jm}\partial_k g_{jm}
      = \partial_k\ln\sqrt{g} = \partial_k\ln\det J,

  which is what allows divergences to be written in terms of :math:`\sqrt{g}`
  below.

**Example: spherical polar coordinates.** For :math:`(\lambda,\varphi,r)`
(longitude, latitude, radius) the metric is
:math:`g=\mathrm{diag}\left(r^2\cos^2\varphi,\;r^2,\;1\right)`
and :math:`\sqrt{g}=r^2\cos\varphi`. The non-zero Christoffel symbols are

.. math::

    \Gamma^\lambda_{\lambda\varphi} = -\tan\varphi, \quad
    \Gamma^\lambda_{\lambda r} = \frac{1}{r}, \quad
    \Gamma^\varphi_{\lambda\lambda} = \sin\varphi\cos\varphi, \quad
    \Gamma^\varphi_{\varphi r} = \frac{1}{r}, \quad
    \Gamma^r_{\lambda\lambda} = -r\cos^2\varphi, \quad
    \Gamma^r_{\varphi\varphi} = -r,

together with those related by the symmetry of the lower indices. For the
equiangular cubed-sphere coordinates :math:`(\alpha,\beta,r)` the metric is
not diagonal, and the Christoffel symbols are best evaluated from
equation :eq:`christoffel_jacobian` or :eq:`christoffel_metric`, using the
Jacobian given in :ref:`coordinates_and_vectors_equiangular_cubed_sphere_coordinates`.

Transport term
--------------

The directional derivative along :math:`\mathbf{a}` is
:math:`(\mathbf{a}\cdot\nabla)=\sum_j a^j\partial_j` (see
:ref:`coordinates_and_vectors_vector_components`). Applying this to the vector
:math:`\mathbf{u}` and using equation :eq:`covariant_derivative`, the
:math:`i`-th component of the transport term is

.. math::
    :label: transport_term

    \left[\left(\mathbf{a}\cdot\nabla\right)\mathbf{u}\right]^i
    = \sum_j a^j\nabla_j u^i
    = \sum_j a^j\partial_j u^i + \sum_{j,k}\Gamma^i_{jk}\,a^j u^k .

The first term is the usual advection of the component :math:`u^i` as if it
were a scalar. The second term is the "curvature" term, which couples the
components of :math:`\mathbf{u}` to each other. For example, transporting a
vector that is constant in a Cartesian sense appears to rotate when expressed
in spherical polar components.

Diffusion term
--------------

The gradient of a vector is a rank-2 tensor. With the index :math:`j`
denoting the gradient direction, its components are obtained by raising the
index on the covariant derivative,

.. math::

    \nabla^j u^i = \sum_m g^{jm}\nabla_m u^i
    = \sum_m g^{jm}\left(\partial_m u^i + \sum_k\Gamma^i_{mk}u^k\right).

The metric tensor is needed here because the gradient involves the *dual*
basis, :math:`\mathbf{e}^j = \sum_m g^{jm}\mathbf{e}_m`. We define the
diffusive flux tensor

.. math::
    :label: flux_definition

    F^{ij} := \rho\nu\,\nabla^j u^i
    = \rho\nu\sum_m g^{jm}\left(\partial_m u^i
    + \sum_k\Gamma^i_{mk}u^k\right).

The divergence over the gradient index of a rank-2 tensor :math:`T^{ij}` is

.. math::

    \left[\nabla\cdot T\right]^i = \sum_j\nabla_j T^{ij}
    = \sum_j\partial_j T^{ij} + \sum_{j,k}\Gamma^j_{jk}T^{ik}
    + \sum_{j,k}\Gamma^i_{jk}T^{kj},

where there is one Christoffel term for each index. Using
equation :eq:`christoffel_trace` the first two terms combine to give

.. math::

    \sum_j\partial_j T^{ij} + \sum_{k}\left(\partial_k\ln\sqrt{g}\right)T^{ik}
    = \frac{1}{\sqrt{g}}\sum_j\partial_j\left(\sqrt{g}\,T^{ij}\right),

hence the :math:`i`-th component of the diffusion term is

.. math::
    :label: diffusion_term

    \frac{1}{\rho}\left[\nabla\cdot\left(\rho\nu\nabla\mathbf{u}\right)\right]^i
    = \frac{1}{\rho\sqrt{g}}\sum_j\partial_j\left(\sqrt{g}\,F^{ij}\right)
    + \frac{1}{\rho}\sum_{j,k}\Gamma^i_{jk}F^{kj}.

The first term is the divergence of a flux in the coordinate system, as would
be used for a scalar, with :math:`\sqrt{g}=\det J` converting between the
coordinate-space and physical volumes. The second term is a further curvature
term, which arises because the divergence is taken of a flux that is itself a
vector.

Evolution equation for each component
-------------------------------------

Collecting equations :eq:`transport_term` and :eq:`diffusion_term`, the
evolution of the :math:`i`-th contravariant component of
equation :eq:`vector_equation` is

.. math::
    :label: component_equation

    \frac{\partial u^i}{\partial t}
    + \sum_j a^j\left(\partial_j u^i + \sum_k\Gamma^i_{jk}u^k\right)
    = \frac{1}{\rho\sqrt{g}}\sum_j\partial_j\left(\sqrt{g}\,F^{ij}\right)
    + \frac{1}{\rho}\sum_{j,k}\Gamma^i_{jk}F^{kj},

with :math:`F^{ij}` given by equation :eq:`flux_definition`. Written out in
full, the flux is

.. math::

    \sqrt{g}\,F^{ij} = \sqrt{g}\,\rho\nu\sum_m g^{jm}\left(\partial_m u^i
    + \sum_k\Gamma^i_{mk}u^k\right).

Several remarks:

* For a given :math:`i`, the quantities required are the component
  :math:`u^i` and its derivatives, the other components :math:`u^k` (through
  the Christoffel symbols), the inverse metric :math:`g^{jm}` and the
  determinant :math:`\sqrt{g}=\det J`. All of these follow from the Jacobian
  :math:`J` and its first derivatives, via
  equations :eq:`christoffel_jacobian` and :eq:`christoffel_metric`.
* Because the :math:`\mathbb{W}_2` degrees of freedom are
  :math:`\det J\,u^i`, the contravariant components are the natural variables
  for a model using :math:`\mathbb{W}_2` winds (see
  :ref:`coordinates_and_vectors_vector_components`).
* If the coordinates are orthogonal, :math:`g^{jm}` is diagonal and the
  flux simplifies considerably. If :math:`J` is also constant, the
  Christoffel symbols vanish and equation :eq:`component_equation` reduces
  to the scalar equation for each component.
* An approximation that is sometimes made is to treat each component as a
  scalar-like quantity, by dropping the final term in
  equation :eq:`diffusion_term`. This is exact only when
  :math:`\sum_{j,k}\Gamma^i_{jk}F^{kj}` vanishes (e.g. for Cartesian
  coordinates) and is otherwise a model simplification.
